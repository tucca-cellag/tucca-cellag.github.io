  ## 5. Load the required software modules

  ```bash

  # lint the workflow to check for type errors in your config files
  snakemake --lint --profile profiles/slurm

  # run the workflow as a dry-run to check for dag errors
  snakemake all -np --profile profiles/slurm

  # run the workflow
  snakemake all --profile profiles/slurm

  NOTE: If you run the workflow interactively like this, you’ll need to keep
  your computer open and prevent it from going to sleep, until the workflow
  finishes. Alternatively you can submit the workflow to the cluster via
  sbatch, but then you’ll need to be watching your emails for when it fails
  rather than looking at your computer screen.
