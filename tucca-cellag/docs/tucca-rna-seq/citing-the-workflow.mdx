## Citing the Research

### Publications Using tucca-rna-seq

If you publish research using this workflow, please:

1. **Cite the workflow** using the information above
2. **Include the workflow version** used in your methods
3. **Reference the GitHub repository** for reproducibility
4. **Share your configuration files** when possible

### Example Methods Section

```
RNA-seq data analysis was performed using the tucca-rna-seq workflow 
(Bromberg & Kaplan, 2025; https://github.com/tucca-cellag/tucca-rna-seq). 
Raw reads were quality-controlled using FastQC and aligned to the reference 
genome using STAR. Transcript quantification was performed with Salmon, and 
differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2. Functional 
enrichment analysis was performed using clusterProfiler and SPIA.
