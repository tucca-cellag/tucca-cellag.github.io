# `tucca-rna-seq`: An RNA-Seq Workflow

The **`tucca-rna-seq`** workflow is a comprehensive solution for RNA-Seq data
analysis. It provides a fast, automated pipeline for researchers and
bioinformaticians, regardless of their programming experience.

Originally developed for cellular agriculture research, this workflow is
designed to be a robust, user-friendly toolset that streamlines RNA-Seq
data analysis, ensuring accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability for any
research field.

Our goal is to accelerate research by providing a powerful, accessible, and
well-documented workflow. For those interested in the cellular agriculture
origins of this project, you can learn more [here](/helpful-resources/learn-about-cell-ag).

## Real-World Impact: A Case Study in Cellular Agriculture

This workflow has been instrumental in generating novel scientific insights for
published research. An early development version of `tucca-rna-seq` was pivotal
in a study on cellular adaptation for cultivated meat, enabling the discovery of
key biological mechanisms that govern how cells transition from adherent to
suspension growth.

This case study demonstrates how the workflow can be leveraged to translate raw
sequencing data into a deeper biological understanding.

## About the Workflow

The **`tucca-rna-seq`** workflow provides an efficient and seamless pipeline for
RNA-Seq data analysis. Key features include:

### Comprehensive Data Processing

- **Quality Control**: Implements `FastQC` and `Qualimap` for quality
  assessment with configurable parameters.
- **Quantification**: Employs `Salmon` for fast, accurate transcript
  quantification, accounting for experimental attributes and biases.
- **Meta-Analysis**: Aggregates results using `MultiQC` for a unified
  overview of data quality and processing metrics.

### Advanced Differential Expression Analysis

- **Statistical Tools**: Leverages `DESeq2` for robust differential
  expression analysis.
- **Flexible Configurations**: Supports multiple experimental designs and
  contrasts in a single run, with configurable statistical parameters.
- **Data Transformation**: Provides variance-stabilizing transformations
  (rlog, vst) for downstream analysis.

### Comprehensive Functional Enrichment

The workflow integrates multiple enrichment analysis approaches:

- **Standard Analysis**: GO, KEGG, and WikiPathways using `clusterProfiler`.
- **MSigDB Integration**: Access to 8 major gene set collections with custom
  GMT file support.
- **SPIA Analysis**: Topology-based pathway impact analysis.
- **Harmonizome Database**: Tissue-specific gene sets from various
  expression datasets.
- **Custom Gene Sets**: Support for user-defined gene sets and pathways.

### Post-Analysis Interactive Tools

- **RMarkdown Playgrounds**: Interactive notebooks for data exploration and
  visualization.
- **PCA Explorer**: Interactive principal component analysis and sample
  clustering.
- **GeneTonic Integration**: Comprehensive enrichment analysis visualization
  with exportable figures.
- **Custom Analysis**: A framework for extending analysis beyond workflow
  outputs.

:::info[Interactive Visualization & Export]
The integrated Shiny applications (GeneTonic, pcaExplorer) provide
interactive visualization experiences that allow you to download plots and
figures in multiple formats (PNG, PDF, SVG) directly from the apps.
:::

### High Reproducibility

- **Environment Management**: Employs `conda` and `renv` to replicate
  computational environments, ensuring consistency.
- **Container Integration**: Uses Singularity/Apptainer containers for
  consistent execution environments.
- **Schema Validation**: JSON schema validation for configuration files.
- **Version Control**: Maintains version-controlled workflows with
  `Snakemake` and `git` for tracking and replication.

### Scalability and Flexibility

- **HPC Integration**: Optimized for high-performance computing clusters.
- **Multiple Execution Environments**: Support for Slurm, LSF, Kubernetes,
  and cloud platforms.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible and customizable.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive CI/CD testing with GitHub
  Actions.

### Modern Snakemake Integration

- **Snakemake v8+**: Built for the latest Snakemake with modern executor
  plugins.
- **Executor Plugins**: Dedicated plugins for different computing
  environments.
- **Simplified Profiles**: Easy-to-configure execution profiles.
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent resource allocation and job
  scheduling.

## Workflow Rule Graph

The diagram below illustrates the rule graph (DAG) for the `tucca-rna-seq`
Snakemake workflow. Each node represents a workflow rule, and edges indicate
dependencies between steps. This provides a high-level view of how data moves
through the pipeline from raw input to final results.
