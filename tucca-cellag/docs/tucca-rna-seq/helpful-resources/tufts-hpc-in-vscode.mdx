with any questions.

Thank you for your patience

## **Step 0: Establish a VPN connection**

Whether you are on or off of Tufts campus, you'll will need to be first
connected to the Tufts VPN. For instructions, see https://access.tufts.edu/vpn

:::warning
**Even if you are on-campus, we always recommend that you connect to the Tufts
VPN when interfacing with the Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC).**

- Only connecting to the HPC through the `Tufts Secure` Wi-Fi network can be
problematic due to intermittent connection drops that will make you temporarily
lose connection to the HPC and can potentially lead to errors when running this
workflow. This problem is especially prevalent when connecting via VSCode.

- Additionally, you will not need to need to authorize your interactions with
the HPC on Duo as frequently, if at all, after you initially connect to the VPN.

## **Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free, open-source code editor developed by
Microsoft. It's widely used for software development due to its versatility,
rich feature set, and extensive extension ecosystem. In the context of
interacting with the Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, VSCode
offers several advantages:

- **Remote Development**: VSCode can seamlessly connect to remote servers,
  allowing you to edit files, run code, and manage projects directly on the
  HPC without leaving your local environment.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Access the HPC terminal within VSCode, enabling
  efficient command-line operations alongside your coding activities.
- **Extensions and Customization**: Enhance your development experience with
  extensions tailored for specific programming languages, debugging tools, and
  workflow optimizations.

## **Step 2: Install Recommended Extensions for HPC Access**

To enhance your experience when working with the Tufts HPC, consider
installing the following extensions:

:::tip
While not all of these extensions are required they are all
**highly recommended** as they will dramatically improve your coding
experience when using VSCode in conjunction with this workflow.

## **Step 3: Configuring `SSH FS` to Remotely Connect to the Tufts HPC**

### Set-Up SSH Keyless Access to the Tufts HPC

Please follow the instructions below to setup your SSH keyless access.
This will make your life much easier in the long run as you will not need to
input your password every time you connect to the cluster using VSCode.

  text="Instructions to Set-Up SSH Keyless Access"
/>

{/* 
TODO: Finish translating the linked instructions to this document 
TODO: Test with Archana
*/}

You'll need your Tufts Username, which usually looks something like 'jdoe02' or
'dkaplan29'.

Execute the following SSH command at a UNIX-like terminal at your laptop or
desktop:

Terminal of your laptop IN:

    ssh TUFTS_USERNAME@login.cluster.tufts.edu

Expected OUT:

    (prompt for a password)

You'll be prompted to enter your Tufts password. Please enter it.

After successful password entry, you should see an active terminal session appear. If you look at your terminal prompt, you'll see something like 'TUFTS_USERNAME@login001'. This means you've successfully ssh-ed into a 'login' node on the cluster.
