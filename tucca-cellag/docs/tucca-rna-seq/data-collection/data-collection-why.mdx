# RNA-Seq Analysis Data Collection Template

Before setting up and running the `tucca-rna-seq` workflow, it's essential 
to collect and organize all the necessary information about your experiment. 
This comprehensive template ensures you have everything needed for a thorough 
and effective RNA-seq analysis.

Having complete information upfront helps:
- Avoid workflow failures due to missing data
- Ensure proper sample organization
- Set appropriate analysis parameters
- Plan for storage and computational requirements
- Facilitate collaboration and reproducibility

:::tip[Planning for Publication and Data Sharing]
Collecting comprehensive metadata from the start not only ensures a smooth
analysis but also greatly simplifies the process of submitting your data to
public archives like NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Adhering to open
science principles by sharing your data makes your research more impactful and
reproducible.

For an excellent guide on this process, we recommend the following paper:
