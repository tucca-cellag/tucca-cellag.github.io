# Tufts HPC Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Tufts-specific documentation for the `tucca-rna-seq` workflow!
These guides provide essential information for using the workflow on the 
Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

:::tip[Start Here]
This guide provides **Tufts-specific** quick start information. For complete 
installation and setup instructions, see the [main Installation Guide](./../install-and-config/installation) first.
:::

This guide covers the essential Tufts-specific steps to get you running the 
`tucca-rna-seq` workflow on the Tufts HPC cluster quickly.

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Tufts HPC Account

You need a **Tufts Cluster Account** to access the HPC cluster:

<Button
  label="Request an Account"
  link="https://access.tufts.edu/research-cluster-account"
  variant="primary"
  style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}
/>

**Requirements:**
- Valid Tufts Username and Password
- Faculty or researcher sponsorship (for guest/student accounts)
- Approval process takes multiple business days

<Button
  label="TTS Research Technology Guides - HPC Account Request"
  link="https://rtguides.it.tufts.edu/hpc/access/10-account-request.html"
  variant="secondary"
/>

---

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Connect to Tufts HPC

**SSH Access (Recommended):**
```bash
ssh your_utln@login.tufts.edu
```

**VSCode Remote Development (Highly Recommended):**
<Button
  label="Setting Up Tufts HPC Access in VSCode"
  link="/tucca-rna-seq/tufts-specific/tufts-hpc-in-vscode"
  variant="primary"
/>

### 2. Get Off Login Node

```bash
# Request interactive compute node
srun -p interactive --pty bash
```

### 3. Load Required Modules

```bash
# Purge all currently loaded modules
module purge

# Load required modules for tucca-rna-seq
module load snakemake/8.27.1
module load singularity/3.8.4
module load miniforge/24.11.2-py312
```

### 4. Navigate to Lab Workspace

```bash
# For Kaplan Lab users
cd /cluster/tufts/kaplanlab/your_utln

# For other labs
cd /cluster/tufts/your_lab/your_utln

# Create project directory
mkdir my_rnaseq_project
cd my_rnaseq_project
```

:::tip[Set Up a Shared Software Cache!]
Your home directory on the cluster has a strict storage quota. To avoid errors
and speed up future analyses, we **strongly recommend** setting up a permanent,
shared cache for software environments in your lab's shared workspace *before*
you run the workflow for the first time.

See the [**HPC Best Practices Guide**](./hpc-best-practices#persistent-software-caching)
for detailed instructions.
:::

### 5. Clone and Setup Workflow

For detailed instructions on cloning the repository and setting up the workflow's 
dependencies, please follow the main [Installation Guide](./../install-and-config/installation).

After cloning, you will need to configure the workflow for your specific
analysis. This includes editing the main `config.yaml` file and associated
sample sheets, as well as customizing the `slurm` execution profile to add
your email for job notifications.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the main
[Configuration Guide](./../install-and-config/configuration).
