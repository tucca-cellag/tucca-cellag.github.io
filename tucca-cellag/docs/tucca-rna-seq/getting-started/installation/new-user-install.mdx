**ðŸ”„ Setting Up a Fresh Project**

If you've already run the `tucca-rna-seq` workflow but want to start a new
project or analysis without affecting your previous workâ€”which is crucial for
maintaining reproducibilityâ€”check out our guide on setting up a fresh project:

- **[Setting Up a Fresh Project](/tucca-rna-seq/fresh-project-install)**

{/* 
  TODO: Maybe recommend that the workflow be copied to their own git account as 
  git template and then cloned to the cluster so that their changes can be
  version controlled on git?

    ## 1. Login to the Tufts HPC

    You can SSH into the Tufts HPC in the command-line of your preferred
    terminal or you can access the cluster through Tufts' OnDemand service. You
    will need a Tufts Cluster Account to be able to log in to the Tufts HPC.

    :::warning

    The process of requesting and being approved for a Tufts HPC account can
    take multiple business days.

      text="Request an Account"
    />

    **Requirements**

    - You must complete an online account request form and be approved to use
    the Tufts Research Cluster.
    - Account requests require a valid Tufts Username and Tufts Password
    - Guest and student accounts require faculty or researcher sponsorship

    :::

    **SSH**, or **Secure Shell**, is a protocol that allows you to securely
    connect to remote servers over a network. An **HPC**, or **High-Performance
    Computing** system, provides powerful computational resources for executing
    complex simulations and data analyses. Using SSH to access the HPC ensures
    that your data and commands are transmitted securely. The Tufts HPC enables
    researchers and students to perform large-scale computations efficiently.

    fantastic resources to learn more:

    :::tip

    For this workflow, we highly recommend SSHing into the cluster via
    **VSCode** as it provides a convenient user experience.

    **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** is a free, open-source code editor
    developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for software development due to
    its versatility, rich feature set, and extensive extension ecosystem. In
    the context of interacting with the Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC)
    resources, VSCode offers several advantages:

    - **Remote Development**: VSCode can seamlessly connect to remote servers,
      allowing you to edit files, run code, and manage projects directly on the
      HPC without leaving your local environment.
      
    - **Integrated Terminal**: Access the HPC terminal within VSCode, enabling
      efficient command-line operations alongside your coding activities.
      
    - **Extensions and Customization**: Enhance your development experience
      with extensions tailored for specific programming languages, debugging
      tools, and workflow optimizations.

    Additionally, you can connect via the OnDemand service or your preferred
    terminal.

    ## 2. Get off of a login node

    Once logged into the Tufts HPC run the following to get off a login node and
    onto a compute node so that you can start performing computations.

    After login you are on a Login Node of the cluster (`login-prod-0x`) and in
    your Home Directory (`~` or `/cluster/home/your_utln`). Your terminal
    should look like this:

    ```bash
    $ [your_utln@login-prod-02 ~]
    ```

    To get off a login node run:

    ```bash
    srun -p interactive --pty bash
    ```

    This will allocate a compute node with bash shell, 1 CPU core (default),
    4 hours (interactive partition default and maxmimum value), and 2GB of CPU
    memory (default). If desired, modify with number of CPU cores `-n` , memory
    `--mem=` , an alternative partition `-p` , and/or runtime `--time=` .

    Depending on the current usage of the Tufts HPC, you may need to wait in a
    queue to be allocated enough resources. This could take some time depending
    on the current usage of the cluster.

    ## 3. Clone the repository

    :::info[As explained on GitHub's Docs...]

    Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that
    GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file
    and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote
    repository on GitHub.com, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.com.
    For more information, see [Using Git][using-git].

    :::

    Navigate to the desired parent directory (aka folder) on the Tufts HPC that
    you would like to clone (aka copy) the template workflow repository into.
    Then clone the repository with the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/benjibromberg/tucca-rna-seq.git
    ```

    After cloning the repo, you can change the name of the cloned directory
    to suit your project. The default name will always be `tucca-rna-seq`.

    :::tip

    For Kaplan Lab users, it is recommended to clone the repository into your
    personal directory in the `kaplanlab` workspace. After cloning the repo,
    you can change the name of the cloned directory to suit your project. Refer
    to the Tufts HPC resources linked above if this does not make sense.

    ## 4. Dependencies installation

    For improved reproducibility and reusability of the workflow,
    each individual step of the workflow runs either in its own [Conda][conda]
    virtual environment. As a consequence, running this workflow has very few
    individual dependencies.

    You will need to add the `bioconda` channel to your `base` conda environment
    which loads everytime you load a conda manager like [miniforge][miniforge].
    If this is problematic for some reason, you will need to load another conda
    environment that includes the `conda-forge`, `bioconda`, and `default`
    channels before loading the `snakemake` conda environment which will
    require manually modifying the `run.sh` runner script.

    To add the `bioconda` channel to your `base` conda environment run:

    ```bash
    module load miniforge/24.7.1-py312
    conda activate base
    conda config --add channels bioconda
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    conda config --show channels
    ```

    The result of the final command should match the following:

    ```bash
    channels:
      - conda-forge
      - bioconda
      - defaults
    ```

    Then run the following to create the `snakemake` conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f tucca-rna-seq/install/snakemake.yaml
    ```
