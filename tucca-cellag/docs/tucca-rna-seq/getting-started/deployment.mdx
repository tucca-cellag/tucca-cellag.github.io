### 0a. Deciding how you will run the workflow

TODO: Explain that this workflow requires Snakemake and conda (developed using
miniforge) (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#integrated-package-management)

TODO: Additionally/recommended Singularity or Apptainer (developed using Singularity) (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#ad-hoc-combination-of-conda-package-management-with-containers)

TODO: Explain https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html#profiles

TODO: Explain executor plugins available (https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/index.html)

TODO: Explain profile configured for slurm on Tufts HPC (https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm)

TODO: Explain profile configured for GitHub Actions

TODO: Explain executor plugins available (https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/index.html)

TODO: Explain RAM/Storage requirements

**SSH**, or **Secure Shell**, is a protocol that allows you to securely
connect to remote servers over a network. An **HPC**, or **High-Performance
Compute** cluster, is a remote network of servers that provide powerful
computational resources for executing complex simulations and data analyses
enabling researchers and students to perform large-scale computations
more efficiently, than if they were ran on their own hardware. Many HPC
clusters must be accessed via SHH, to ensure that your data and commands are
transmitted securely.

:::tip

For using this workflow, we highly recommend using an integrated development
environment (IDE), such as **VSCode**.

**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** is a free, open-source code editor
developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for software development due to
its versatility, rich feature set, and extensive extension ecosystem. In
the context of interacting with the Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC)
resources, VSCode offers several advantages:

- **Remote Development**: VSCode can seamlessly connect to remote servers,
  allowing you to edit files, run code, and manage projects directly on the
  HPC without leaving your local environment.
  
- **Integrated Terminal**: Access the HPC terminal within VSCode, enabling
  efficient command-line operations alongside your coding activities.
  
- **Extensions and Customization**: Enhance your development experience
  with extensions tailored for specific programming languages, debugging
  tools, and workflow optimizations.
