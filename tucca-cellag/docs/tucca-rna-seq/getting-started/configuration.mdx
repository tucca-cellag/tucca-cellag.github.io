# Setting Up the `tucca-rna-seq` Workflow for your Analysis


{/*
I havenâ€™t updated the docs so this is what you need to configure:
  
config/config.yaml
  Change ref_assembly to align with the RefSeq, Ensembl, or GENCODE genome
    you want to use
  (Optionally) Add a NCBI API key to api_keys
  Change any parameters for the currently integrated software in params to
    suit your needs

config/units.tsv
  see `workflow/schemas/units.schema.yaml` for instructions on how to fill
    this out. Either add strings to fq1 and fq2 OR add a string to sra  for
    each unit, otherwise the workflow wonâ€™t behave well. Keep the other one
    an empty string. I havenâ€™t added this logic to the schema for units yet
    unfortunately to reinforce this.

config/samples.tsv
  see workflow/schemas/samples.schema.yaml for instructions on how to fill
    this out. All columns besides the required columns are currently just
    for your reference. They will be used once I have finalized the
    differential expression steps for making contrasts.

profiles/slurm/config.v8+.yaml
  change the email address here to be yours so you get emails about failed
  jobs (sorry I havenâ€™t made this configurable yet in the main config file)
