## Installing tucca-rna-seq

:::danger Prerequisites

Prior to installing this workflow, we highly recommend that you are familiar
with:
- Version Control
- Git/GitHub
- Best practices for reproducibility in scientific computing

### 0b. Install required dependencies (if applicable)

{/*
TODO: If necessary install Snakemake and conda. singularity
*/}

---

### 1. Create a fresh directory to work in

Now you will need to set set up a new directory (folder) on that will hold
the workflow and all necessary configuration files you will need to set up
for your specific project.

For example:

```bash
mkdir new_project_directory
cd new_project_directory
```

---

### 2. Clone the repo into your new directory

:::warning
If you are not familiar with version control, Git/GitHub, or best practices
for reproducibility in scientific computing, it is **highly recommended**
that you familiarize yourself with these tools and concepts

<Button
  label="Click here for more details about these topics"
  link="/helpful-resources/reproducibility"
  variant="primary"
/>
:::

Now that you have created and navigated to a fresh project directory,
we need to clone the `tucca-rna-seq` workflow repository into the new
directory. You can clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tucca-cellag/tucca-rna-seq.git
```

:::info[Cloning a repo (as explained on GitHub's docs...)]

Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that
GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file
and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote
repository on GitHub.com, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.com.
For more information, see [Using Git on GitHub][using-git] or [check out our
recommended Git resources][git-resources].

:::tip
If you would like to track your changes for your workflow via version
control, or you would like to share your project's specific
configurations and/or alternations to the workflow via GitHub, you can fork
the repo and then clone your fork of the repo to the cluster.

Now we just need to configure the workflow for your specific analysis!
