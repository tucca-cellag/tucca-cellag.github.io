# Reproducibility in Scientific Computing

## Good enough practices in scientific computing

We highly recommend reading **Good enough practices in scientific computing**
by Wilson *et al*. The first author, Greg Wilson, was a co-founder of Software
Carpentry, an educational resource for researchers that "develops and teaches
workshops on the fundamental programming skills needed to conduct research.
[Software Carpentry's] mission is to provide researchers high-quality,
domain-specific training covering all aspects of research software engineering."

Alternatively, there is a **self-lead lesson** inspired by and based on the
paper available on [The Carpentries Lab](carpentries-lab) (a collection of
peer-reviewed lessons from the carpentries community). The lesson does not need
any specific software installed beyond a web browser. It is mostly
discussion-based, with examples of data organization given and used for the
discussion.

## Introduction to Git/GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and
directories through a series of commits, letting developers branch and merge
code safely while maintaining a full history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting
service for Git repositories that adds a user-friendly web interface, issue
tracking, pull requests for code review, and integrations with CI/CD and project
management tools. Together, they let teams collaborate on the same codebase
concurrently, manage versions, share work publicly or privately, and streamline
development and deployment workflows.
