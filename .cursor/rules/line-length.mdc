# Line Length Convention

All text files should adhere to a maximum line length of 80 characters. This
improves readability and is a standard convention in many projects.

## Good Practice

```
This is a line that is well within the 80-character limit and is easy
to read.
```

## Bad Practice

```
This is a very long line that exceeds the 80-character limit, which makes it
harder to read and requires horizontal scrolling in some editors, which is not
ideal for code reviews or general readability.
```

## Exceptions

- URLs and links are exempt from this rule as they often cannot be broken.
- Code comments containing long URLs or paths.
- Lines in files where breaking them would harm readability or correctness
(e.g., long strings, specific file formats).
